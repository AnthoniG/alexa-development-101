This repository contains code samples and supporting documentation for the course: Alexa Development 101 - An introduction to Alexa Development for absolute beginners.

## About the course

If want to get started programming AND you want to learn how to build skills for Amazon Alexa - this course was created especially for you. By the end of this course, you'll be able to create custom skills for Amazon Alexa - from scratch - even if you've never written a line of code in your life. Guaranteed!

There are a lot of great courses and tutorials available for learning how to build Alexa skills. But, most require some prior programming experience. This course is different - you won't need any prior experience other than some basic computer skills.

This course walks you through creating your fist skill and introduces you to programming with Javascript and Node.js. By the end of the course, you'll be able to create a custom Alexa skill for your own private use or that can be published publicly - and you won't just be copying and pasting to do it - you'll be creating your own skill - from scratch.

The course is made up of a collection of short videos - all of them are under 10-minutes but most are around 5-minutes. So, you can learn in small chunks, when you have the time. Of course, if you prefer, you could also work through the entire course at once - that  would probablly take you about 2-3 hours.
