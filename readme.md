# Alexa Development 101

This repository contains code samples and supporting documentation for the course: Alexa Development 101 - An introduction to building skills for Amazon Alexa.

## About the course

If want to start building skills for Amazon Alexa and you're new to programming - this course was created especially for you! By the end of this course, you'll be able to create custom skills for Amazon Alexa - from scratch - even if you've never written a line of code in your life. Guaranteed!

There are a lot of great courses and tutorials available for learning how to build Alexa skills. But, most require some prior programming experience. This course is different - you won't need any prior experience other than some basic computer skills.

You'll learn how to create your fist skill for Amazon Alexa using Javascript and Node.js. In the course, you'll create a custom Alexa skill for your own private use or that can be published publicly - and you won't just be copying and pasting to do it - you'll be creating it from scratch and based on your own idea.

The course is made up of a collection of short lessons - all but one of them are under 10-minutes but most are around 5-minutes. So, you can learn in small chunks, when you have the time. Of course, if you prefer, you could also work through the entire course at once - that  would probablly take you about 2-3 hours (including time to do the exercises).

### The course goal
